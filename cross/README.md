Alek Westover

This is an Alexa skill for when you are trying to compute cross products of 2 vectors
taking a cross product is not fun by hand, but by making Alexa do it it becomes much faster
this is especially useful if you cannot have your computer open while you are doing your math homework (too distracting, not enough space etc) that makes this skill significantly convenient
